# Image Denoising
# Frequency Attention Network
This project is for a image denoising networks which I called it Frequency Attention Network(FAN).
This network combine frequency analysis and neural network to solve real-image denoising task and can achieve outstanding performance compared with other methods on SIDD and DND benchmarks.

The test code and train code will be released soon!
