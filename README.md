# Image Denoising
# Frequency Denoising Network
This project is for a image denoising networks which I called it Frequency Denoising Network.
This network combine frequency analysis and neural network to solve real-image denoising task and can achieve SOTA performance compared with other methods.
I test my network on SIDD dataset, DND dataset and mixed Gaussian-Poisson noise.
The code will release when I finish my paper. 
"It will come soon:)"
